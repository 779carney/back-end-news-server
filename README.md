# Setup 

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.

You'll need to run npm install to install relevent packages to this project
